# table-html
This project is a daily routine timetable built using HTML and CSS, demonstrating the use of tables to organize schedules. Days and time slots are structured in rows and columns, with tasks outlined for each period. The table features color-coded cells for better clarity and uses CSS for styling, making it visually appealing and easy to read.
